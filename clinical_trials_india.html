Clindox has a development team, customer service team and a sales team based in Pune. Consequently, we are ideally situated to meet the needs and understand the requirements of our clients based in India. 
Our CRfweb system is perfectly suited to clinical trials in the Indian market. In addition to our remarkably fast set-up time, and simple to design and use format:
•	our language facility enables us to handle studies with data collection across multiple dialects
•	our ePRO module enables subjects to enter data themselves. It also enables data collection offline by the investigator in areas where there is no secure internet connection... and data can then seamlessly sync when a secure connection becomes available.
